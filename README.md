# Loan-Flagging-Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores, trains, and tests different machine learning models on a given dataset with the goal of predicting the bad_flag target variable.

The notebook includes a comprehensive analysis and comparison of various models' performances.

We delve into techniques such as data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, hyperparameter optimization, and more. We evaluate and argue for the choice of the best model based on its performance and suitability for the task.

Additionally, the notebook demonstrates the expected default rate at different approval levels, providing key insights into risk management for decision-makers.

Whether you're a data scientist interested in predictive modeling, a business professional in need of understanding risk analysis, or a machine learning enthusiast, this repository provides valuable insights and code samples for building robust predictive models.
